- Converts all color settings to new Indigo Color Picker. This may cause users
  to need to re-enter color preferences in the plugin configuration (affecting

  individually.) This should only need to be done once, and will not be needed
  for new devices.

    . Bar Chart Devices
    . Line Chart Devices

v0.4.08
- Adds a new Action Item to refresh individual charts. Useful when a single
  data point changes (i.e., device state or variable value).
- Makes the clean_string() method optional for multiline text charts.
- Removes the need to manually refresh the list of values to chart when
  selecting a data source for multiline text charts (removes the 'Refresh'
  button).

- Stylistic changes to Indigo Plugin Update Checker module.
- Improves code used to read and write select information from the plugin logs
  folder.

  longer regenerate all charts automatically. Feature wasn't working well on
  slower servers with a lot of charts.

v0.2.05
- Fixes bug where certain combinations of temperatures would cause below zero
  temperatures to be plotted outside the boundaries of the plot.
- Fixes (?) all instances where the plugin will save a CSV value of 'None'
  would be saved to the file (changes it to 'NaN').

  collisions.
- Refines plotting of 10 Day weather forecast devices to always place higher
  display   priority on high temperature line.
