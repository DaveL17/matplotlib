  on Y2.
- Logs warning when CSV Engine data element source ID is None type.
- Properly sets the state of the device indicator in the main Indigo UI (green
  if enabled, gray if disabled), and provides a small set of status messages
  as the plugin cycles.
- Fixes bug where certain devices with unicode characters in a path name would
  fail.
- Fixes bug where 'pixel', 'triangle left' and 'triangle right' marker styles
  would cause an error (scatter charts only).
- Minor UI refinements.
- Various code refinements.
- Various error reporting improvements.

v0.4.01
- Adds new Scatter chart type.
- Adds baseline API to allow scripters the ability to send data to create
  charts.
- Adds ability to modify legend labels with custom text (bar, line and scatter
  charts only).
- Adds ability to mirror Y axis value labels to Y2 (bar, line and scatter
  charts only).
- Adds ability to hide the X (surrounding) and Y (radial) labels for polar
  charts.
- Adds advanced settings menu item to force origin lines to be plotted when
  charts contain both positive and negative values.
- Fixes the min/max settings for precipitation values on weather charts.
- Reorganizes most chart device settings (alphabetically within each grouping)
  to make them easier to find.
- Renames the standard rectangular sizes to increase clarity (they were still
  too confusing). They are now Size 1 and Size 2. Size 1 is the default, Size 2
  is the override and Custom Sizes override both Size 1 and Size 2.
- Reduces the minimum size for chart dimensions to 75 pixels.
- Additional fixes for international characters.
- Various code refinements.

v0.3.03
- Adds 4, 8, and 12 hour bins to the X axis.

- Renames "Extra Wide" controls to "Special Size" to better reflect that the
  settings not only control width and height, but can also be smaller or
  larger than the standard size.
- Fixes bug where certain data file names with unicode characters would cause
  an error.
- Moves support URL to Github.
- Various code refinements.

v0.3.02
- Fixes bug in CSV device that caused a crash when Unicode characters were
  contained in device names.

v0.3.01
- Move project to GitHub and increments version number.

v0.2.05
- Fixes bug where certain combinations of temperatures would cause below zero
  temperatures to be plotted outside the boundaries of the plot.
- Fixes (?) all instances where the plugin will save a CSV value of 'None'
  would be saved to the file (changes it to 'NaN').
- Refines annotations to increase readability -- especially during annotation
  collisions.
- Refines plotting of 10 Day weather forecast devices to always place higher
  display   priority on high temperature line.
- Simplifies code used to plot max, min and custom line segments (minor speed
  improvement). Affects bar and line charts.

v0.2.04
- Adds dropdown to CSV Engine to show available data sources (device states
  or variable value).
- Adds device-specific custom font sizes to support retina/non-retina displays.
- Tweaks weather forecast device to increase separation between low temperature
  line and precipitation bar annotations.
- Fixes bug in Matplotlib Action item.
- CSV Engine: changed "Source Title" to "Title",  changed "Source Device" to
  "ID", changed "Source State" to "Data" to be more descriptive of devices and
  variable data sources).

v0.2.03
- Added additional X Axis bins:
  - Every 15 minutes
  - Every 30 minutes
- Links "About Matplotlib" menu item to the new forum.
- Fixes bug when using variables for Multiline Text.

  cycle.
- Fixes a bug where plugin would log inability to import pydevd.
- Fixes a bug where custom color values were not recognized as valid for some
  settings.
