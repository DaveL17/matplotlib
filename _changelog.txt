v0.4.03
- Adds steps-mid and steps-post to linestyles.
- Adds plugin menu items to enable and disable communication for all charting
  devices (includes CSV Engine devices).
- Refactors CSV Engine configuration dialog to pre-populate dropdown menus so
  data no longer needs to be entered manually.
- Adds additional validation checks to CSV Engine device to avoid creation of
  null devices. Includes maintenance code to automatically eliminate null
  devices that have been previously created.
- Better handling of devices that produced a KeyError on 'customAxisLabelY2'.
- Reduces the amount of default debug logging, and introduces a configuration
  setting to allow for verbose logging.

v0.4.02

- Adds optional border around multiline text plots.
- Adds additional option to Mirror Y axis labels to have labels display *only*
  on Y2.
- Logs warning when CSV Engine data element source ID is None type.
- Properly sets the state of the device indicator in the main Indigo UI (green
  if enabled, gray if disabled), and provides a small set of status messages
  as the plugin cycles.
- Fixes bug where certain devices with unicode characters in a path name would
  fail.
- Fixes bug where 'pixel', 'triangle left' and 'triangle right' marker styles
  would cause an error (scatter charts only).

  charts.
- Adds advanced settings menu item to force origin lines to be plotted when
  charts contain both positive and negative values.
- Fixes the min/max settings for precipitation values on weather charts.
- Reorganizes most chart device settings (alphabetically within each grouping)
  to make them easier to find.
- Renames the standard rectangular sizes to increase clarity (they were still
  too confusing). They are now Size 1 and Size 2. Size 1 is the default, Size 2
  is the override and Custom Sizes override both Size 1 and Size 2.

v0.3.03
- Adds 4, 8, and 12 hour bins to the X axis.

  an error.

- Various code refinements.

v0.2.05
- Fixes bug where certain combinations of temperatures would cause below zero
  temperatures to be plotted outside the boundaries of the plot.
- Fixes (?) all instances where the plugin will save a CSV value of 'None'
  would be saved to the file (changes it to 'NaN').
- Refines annotations to increase readability -- especially during annotation
  collisions.
- Refines plotting of 10 Day weather forecast devices to always place higher
  display   priority on high temperature line.
- Simplifies code used to plot max, min and custom line segments (minor speed
  improvement). Affects bar and line charts.

v0.2.04
- Adds dropdown to CSV Engine to show available data sources (device states
  or variable value).
- Adds device-specific custom font sizes to support retina/non-retina displays.
- Tweaks weather forecast device to increase separation between low temperature
  line and precipitation bar annotations.
- Fixes bug in Matplotlib Action item.
- CSV Engine: changed "Source Title" to "Title",  changed "Source Device" to
  "ID", changed "Source State" to "Data" to be more descriptive of devices and
  variable data sources).
