Version: 0.2.02
EmailSubject: Matplotlib Indigo Plugin - Update Available
EmailBody: The Matplotlib Plugin you are using has been updated.

A Matplotlib Plugin update is now available

v0.2.02
- Implements Indigo Version Update Checker.
- Fixes a bug where the CSV engine spawned a None type data element which kept
  some installs from creating CSV data successfully.
- Attempts to fix a bug where the plugin would randomly restart during a sleep
  cycle. Changing from super to indigo.PluginBase didn't seem to solve the
  problem. Tried changing plt.close to plt.close('all').
- Fixes a bug where plugin would log inability to import pydevd.

As always, if something doesn't seem quite right, please let me know.
