EmailSubject: Matplotlib Indigo Plugin - Update Available
EmailBody: The Matplotlib Plugin you are using has been updated.

A Matplotlib Plugin update is now available
v0.4.03
- Adds steps-mid and steps-post to linestyles.
- Adds plugin menu items to enable and disable communication for all charting
  devices (includes CSV Engine devices).
- Refactors CSV Engine configuration dialog to pre-populate dropdown menus so
  data no longer needs to be entered manually.
- Adds additional validation checks to CSV Engine device to avoid creation of
  null devices. Includes maintenance code to automatically eliminate null
  devices that have been previously created.
- Better handling of devices that produced a KeyError on 'customAxisLabelY2'.
- Reduces the amount of default debug logging, and introduces a configuration
  setting to allow for verbose logging.

v0.4.02
- Adds new device type for tracking rcParams.
- Adds optional border around multiline text plots.
- Adds additional option to Mirror Y axis labels to have labels display *only*
  on Y2.
- Logs warning when CSV Engine data element source ID is None type.
- Properly sets the state of the device indicator in the main Indigo UI (green
  if enabled, gray if disabled), and provides a small set of status messages
  as the plugin cycles.
- Fixes bug where certain devices with unicode characters in a path name would
  fail.
- Fixes bug where 'pixel', 'triangle left' and 'triangle right' marker styles
  would cause an error (scatter charts only).
- Minor UI refinements.
- Various code refinements.
- Various error reporting improvements.

As always, if something doesn't seem quite right, please let me know.
