Version: 0.4.14
EmailSubject: Matplotlib Indigo Plugin - Update Available
EmailBody: The Matplotlib Plugin you are using has been updated.

A Matplotlib Plugin update is now available

v0.4.14
- Standardizes plugin menu item styles. Menu items with an ellipsis (...)
  denote that a dialog box will open. Menu items without an ellipsis denote
  that the plugin will take immediate action.

This is a cosmetic release and users can forego updating until the next release.

As always, if something doesn't seem quite right, please let me know.

The update can be downloaded at the following link:
