EmailBody: The Matplotlib Plugin you are using has been updated.

A Matplotlib Plugin update is now available

v0.4.01
- Adds new Scatter chart type.
- Adds baseline API to allow scripters the ability to send data to create
  charts.
- Adds ability to modify legend labels with custom text (bar, line and scatter
  charts only).
- Adds ability to mirror Y axis value labels to Y2 (bar, line and scatter
  charts only).
- Adds ability to hide the X (surrounding) and Y (radial) labels for polar
  charts.
- Adds advanced settings menu item to force origin lines to be plotted when
  charts contain both positive and negative values.
- Fixes the min/max settings for precipitation values on weather charts.
- Reorganizes most chart device settings (alphabetically within each grouping)
  to make them easier to find.
- Renames the standard rectangular sizes to increase clarity (they were still
  too confusing). They are now Size 1 and Size 2. Size 1 is the default, Size 2
  is the override and Custom Sizes override both Size 1 and Size 2.
- Reduces the minimum size for chart dimensions to 75 pixels.
- Additional fixes for international characters.
- Various code refinements.

As always, if something doesn't seem quite right, please let me know.
