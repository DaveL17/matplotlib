Version: 0.4.13
EmailSubject: Matplotlib Indigo Plugin - Update Available
EmailBody: The Matplotlib Plugin you are using has been updated.

A Matplotlib Plugin update is now available

v0.4.13
- Improve font list generation.

v0.4.12
- Converts all color settings to new Indigo Color Picker. This may cause users
  to need to re-enter color preferences in the plugin configuration (affecting
  all charts at once) and each device configuration (affecting devices
  individually.) This should only need to be done once, and will not be needed
  for new devices.
- Improves multiprocessing logging.

v0.4.11
- The following devices have been moved to a multiprocessing environment:
    . Bar Chart Devices
    . Line Chart Devices
    . Polar Chart Devices
    . Scatter Chart Devices
- Adds trap for Matplotlib runtime error when charts are refreshed.

v0.4.10
- The following devices have been moved to a multiprocessing environment:
    . Calendar Devices
    . Multiline Text Devices
    . Weather Forecast Devices
- Fixes error in debug logging where 'isError' attribute was used with API 2.0
  logging.

v0.4.09
- Fixes bug where CSV data are updated once per minute when refresh interval
  set to manual only.
- Ensures that refresh interval is updated as soon as the setting is changed.

As always, if something doesn't seem quite right, please let me know.
