Version: 0.4.08
EmailSubject: Matplotlib Indigo Plugin - Update Available
EmailBody: The Matplotlib Plugin you are using has been updated.

A Matplotlib Plugin update is now available

This is a minor release. Users whose installs are functioning well
do not need to install this patch.

v0.4.08

- Adds a new Action Item to refresh individual charts. Useful when a single data point changes (i.e., device state or variable value).
- Makes the cleanUpString() method optional for multiline text charts.
- Removes the need to manually refresh the list of values to chart when selecting a data source for multiline text charts (removes the 'Refresh' button).
- Updates plugin to require Indigo API version 2.0 (as Indigo 7 is required in order to run the plugin).
- Testing new multiprocessing feature with multiline charts. Should not cause any observable differences in plugin operation.
- Plugin now only calls the Matplotlib AGG backend.
- Stylistic changes to Indigo Plugin Update Checker module.
- Improves code used to read and write select information from the plugin logs folder.
- Saving plugin configuration (or advanced settings configuration) will no longer regenerate all charts automatically. Feature wasn't working well on slower servers with a lot of charts.
- Further reduces the amount of information written to the debug log.

As always, if something doesn't seem quite right, please let me know.
